Code of Conduct
---------------

Meeting:
--------
Frequency and Duration:
Hold weekly meetings for up to one hour to keep everyone updated and aligned with project goals. 
If needed, set up emergency meetings with at least 24 hours' notice.

Agenda Setting:
Share meeting agendas 48 hours in advance to include everyone’s input. 
Agendas will cover updates, task assignments, solving issues, and collecting team feedback.

Participation:
Make sure every team member actively participates, making the meeting space inclusive and respectful of all opinions. 
Use methods like round-robin for fair speaking opportunities and digital tools for joint note-taking and engagement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Punctuality:
------------
Encourage timely participation, recognizing that respect for everyone’s time strengthens team cohesion. 
In instances of lateness, suggest a brief update or contribution to the team's knowledge base as a constructive response.

Attendance:
Stress the importance of presence for all team engagements, allowing for flexibility with prior notice. 
For absences, a summary of missed content or an extra contribution to team discussions can be a supportive alternative.

Completion of Assigned Work:
Emphasize the responsibility for task completion, encouraging peer support for challenges faced. 
If tasks are uncompleted, a plan for support and reallocation of resources could be more beneficial than punitive measures.

Timely Completion of Work:
Highlight the importance of adhering to deadlines, with a focus on proactive communication for any delays. 
Offering additional support or resources to help meet project timelines can foster a collaborative atmosphere.

Adherence to Rules:
Reinforce adherence to established guidelines with a focus on collective responsibility. 
Introduce a reflective discussion on rule importance and impact on team dynamics as a constructive approach to infractions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enforcement:
------------
Maintain a system where any team member can report concerns, with the project lead facilitating a resolution-focused discussion. 
This approach encourages a culture of accountability and mutual respect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rewards for Rule Compliance:
----------------------------
Following Rules: 
Team members who consistently follow rules get praised in team meetings. 
This shows everyone's appreciation for their dedication and encourages others.

Early Task Completion: 
If you finish your tasks early, you'll get a chance to chose what task you want to do for the next sprint. 
This reward is for recognizing your efficient work and helps you grow professionally.

Extra Contributions: 
Those who contribute more than expected will receive a cash bonus from the team. 
This shows gratitude for their extra effort and motivates everyone to go above and beyond.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Punishments for Rule Violations:
--------------------------------
In the event of a rule violation:
Offer to lead a brief team-building activity or share a learning resource related to the project's goals. 
This encourages personal development and team cohesion.

For Failing to Complete Assigned Work:
Propose a session to share insights or a recent learning experience with the team. This turns the focus towards growth and contribution rather than simple penalization.

For Delays in Task Completion:
Suggest contributing additional time to support a team member's task or the collective project needs, fostering a culture of support and cooperation.

For Not Adhering to Rules:
Initiate a constructive feedback session where the individual can offer suggestions for improving team workflows or project management practices, encouraging positive contributions to the team's functioning.
