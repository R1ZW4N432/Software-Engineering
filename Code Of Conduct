Code of Conduct
---------------

Punctuality:
Encourage timely participation, recognizing that respect for everyoneâ€™s time strengthens team cohesion. 
In instances of lateness, suggest a brief update or contribution to the team's knowledge base as a constructive response.

Attendance:
Stress the importance of presence for all team engagements, allowing for flexibility with prior notice. 
For absences, a summary of missed content or an extra contribution to team discussions can be a supportive alternative.

Completion of Assigned Work:
Emphasize the responsibility for task completion, encouraging peer support for challenges faced. 
If tasks are uncompleted, a plan for support and reallocation of resources could be more beneficial than punitive measures.

Timely Completion of Work:
Highlight the importance of adhering to deadlines, with a focus on proactive communication for any delays. 
Offering additional support or resources to help meet project timelines can foster a collaborative atmosphere.

Adherence to Rules:
Reinforce adherence to established guidelines with a focus on collective responsibility. 
Introduce a reflective discussion on rule importance and impact on team dynamics as a constructive approach to infractions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enforcement:

Maintain a system where any team member can report concerns, with the project lead facilitating a resolution-focused discussion. 
This approach encourages a culture of accountability and mutual respect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Punishments for Rule Violations:

In the event of a rule violation, the following punishments will be implemented:
Offer to lead a brief team-building activity or share a learning resource related to the project's goals. 
This encourages personal development and team cohesion.

For Failing to Complete Assigned Work:
Propose a session to share insights or a recent learning experience with the team. This turns the focus towards growth and contribution rather than simple penalization.

For Delays in Task Completion:
Suggest contributing additional time to support a team member's task or the collective project needs, fostering a culture of support and cooperation.

For Not Adhering to Rules:
Initiate a constructive feedback session where the individual can offer suggestions for improving team workflows or project management practices, encouraging positive contributions to the team's functioning.
