User Cases

User Story 1
I can conduct demographic analysis and reporting as a data analyst by retrieving population data for countries, continents, regions, cities, districts, and capital cities.
Requirements for satisfaction:
1.	Use a database query to get population statistics for entities: 
•  Verify that the SQL queries used to retrieve population data from the supplied database tables are properly generated.
•  Confirm that population projections for countries, continents, regions, cities, districts, and capital cities are included in the data that was retrieved.

2.	 Ensure that current and accurate population data is retrieved: 
•  Confirm that the population data is accurate and up to date.
•  Put in place systems to update population statistics in the event that the database changes. 


3.	Address errors effectively when there are incorrect inputs or problems with database connectivity: 
•  Put error handling procedures in place to deal with situations like incorrect input parameters or unsuccessful database connections. 
•  When issues are encountered, give users informative error messages.


Administrators

-	I must consistently update the database with the most recent demographic data as a database administrator to ensure accuracy.
It is my responsibility as a system administrator to make sure the system is secure from unauthorised entry. 

-	I have to restrict user access to confidential information within the role as a user manager.


User Story 2

In order to examine population trends using multiple geographic characteristics, I, as a researcher, I am able to sort and filter population data according to several criteria, including continent, region, country, and district.
Requirements for satisfaction:
1.	 Use sorting functionality to put population-based data in either ascending or descending order: 
•  Enable users to choose the preferred sorting order for population data, such as ascending or descending.
•  Confirm that the sorting process correctly rearranges population data according to the given criteria. 

2.	Offer filtering choices to limit population data according to predetermined standards: 
•  To allow users to concentrate on particular geographic locations, include filters for continent, region, country, and district. 
•  Verify that population data related to chosen criteria is successfully retrieved and shown by filtering processes. 

3.	Provide a successful and efficient operation of the sorting and filtering processes: 
•  Improve sorting and filtering algorithms to effectively handle large amounts of data. 
•  Test the sorting and filtering functionalities' responsiveness under multiple load of scenarios by doing performance testing.


User Story 3

As an educator, I can adjust my population examination to meet certain needs by entering a number (N) to obtain the top 'N' populated entities (cities, capital cities, and countries).
Requirements for satisfaction:
1.	Take in the input from the user for "N" and verify that it is a positive integer: 
Verify the user's input to make sure it falls inside a suitable range and is a positive integer.
• If input validation is unsuccessful, advise users with feedback so they can enter a valid 'N' value. 

2.	Based on user input, get and show the top 'N' filled entities: 
The database will be accessed to retrieve the top 'N' inhabited entities according to predetermined criteria, such as countries, cities, and capital cities. 
•  Clearly and neatly display the retrieved data, showing the population of each object.

3.	Deal with edge conditions, such as when 'N' exceeds the entire number of entities that are available: 
•  Develop procedures to deal with situations in which the requested 'N' is greater than the total number of entities that are accessible.
•  In the event that users run into these edge conditions, send them the correct message.

Postconditions: In response to their request, the user is given a list of the top N filled entities. 

Alternative Flows: The system returns all entries if 'N' is greater than the total number of entries that are accessible.


User Story 4

In order to analyse the distribution of languages across the globe, as a demographic analyst, I am able to obtain population statistics for speakers of particular languages, like Chinese, English, Hindi, Spanish, and Arabic.
Requirements for satisfaction:
1.	Use a database query to get population statistics for speakers of particular languages: 
• Create SQL queries to retrieve demographic information for individuals who speak those languages (English, Hindi, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic).
• Verify that the mapping of language data to related population figures is accurate.

2.	Determine what proportion of people around the World speak each language: 
Determine the proportion of the global population that speaks each language. 
•  Verify the accuracy of the percentage figures by taking the entire global population into account. 


3.	Display language population data with speakers arranged in decreasing order: 
•  Sort language population data according to the quantity of speakers in each language. 
• For simplified analysis, present language population statistics in a visually engaging and understandable format.
